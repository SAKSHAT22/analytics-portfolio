📌 Project Overview

This is a Tableau learning project created by following Andy Kriebel’s tutorial on building actionable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

The focus of this project is not just on creating visuals, but on understanding how to design KPIs that clearly track organizational goals and performance.

Through this project, I learned how KPIs help answer:

What are we trying to achieve?

How are we performing so far?

Are we ahead or behind our target?

What action should be taken?

🎯 What I Learned About KPIs

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a structured way of comparing goals vs actual performance.
They help measure progress and guide decision-making.

✅ Must-Haves for Effective KPIs

An effective KPI should clearly communicate:

Progress – How are we performing so far?

Target – What benchmark or goal are we comparing against?

Status – Are we above, below, or meeting the target?

Action – A clear visual indicator showing good or bad performance

📊 Types of KPIs Practiced

In this project, I explored different KPI presentation styles, including:

Big Number KPIs – Highlighting key metrics at a glance

Sparklines – Showing trends over time in a compact form

Bar Chart KPIs – Comparing actuals against targets

Combined KPIs – Using numbers + trends + color indicators

🛠 Tools Used

Tableau Public


🧩 Dataset Used

Dataset Name: Sample - Superstore

Common Tableau practice dataset containing:

Sales

Profit

Orders

Categories and Sub-Categories

Regions and Dates

This dataset is widely used for learning business performance analysis and KPI design.

📘 What I Practiced & Learned

Understanding KPI design principles

Defining goals and targets for business metrics

Creating calculated fields for KPI logic

Using color and indicators for performance status

Designing KPIs that clearly suggest actionable insights

Improving dashboard clarity and storytelling

✨ Key Takeaway

After completing this project, I gained a clearer understanding of how to develop actionable KPIs that effectively track an organization’s goals and objectives, rather than just displaying numbers.

This learning forms a strong foundation for building executive-level dashboards in Tableau.

⚠️ Note

This is a learning-focused Tableau project created for skill development.
The dashboard logic is inspired by Andy Kriebel’s tutorial and implemented using a public sample dataset.
